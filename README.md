# A-Data-Science-Blog-Post 
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project to write a Blog Post
## Table of Contents
The project is using the following Python Libraries Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn  
The code should run using Python versions 3.7 or above. The notebook is written and tested via jupyter framework
## Project
This project aims to understand Airbnb data in Istanbul using CRISP-DM metodology. The following questions were asked:
1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Istanbul? By how much do prices spike?
2. Which neighbourhoods are more popular to stay at?
3. Is there a relationship between number of accommodations, beds and bathrooms and price?

## File Descriptions

A_Data_Science_Blog_Post.ipynb: The iPython notebook containing all calculations, figures, and findings pertaining to the project. 

calendar.csv: A file containing all of the dates available for listings as well as price  

listings.csv: A file containing all of the information for listings  

## Summary
Following conclusions inferred from the analysis

1. House prices in Istanbul is relatively cheaper in the second half than the first.
2. Places that are close to city center offer more listings such as Beyoğlu, Şişli and Fatih.
3. A defitinite relationship between accommodations, bed, bathrooms and prices could not be reach, due to the low explanatory power of our model.

The summary analysis of the results can be found in this [post](https://medium.com/@ozdemir.melisecem/airbnb-in-istanbul-cb0d64c8202d).
